--BEGIN--RANDOM VECTORS--27/11/2025
1. Random vector
𖦹 A vector is a simple list of numbers.
𖦹 A random vector is a list where each number is a random variable.
• Example: X = [X1, X2, X3]
- Each Xi can take different values because it is random.

2. Random matrix
𖦹 A matrix is like a small table of numbers.
𖦹 A random matrix is a table where each entry is a random variable.
• Example:  
  X = [ X11  X12  
        X21  X22 ]
- Each Xij is random.

3. Expected value
𖦹 Expected value of a random number X is the average value you get if you repeat the process many times.
𖦹 For a random vector, the expected value is a vector of expected values of each part.
• Example: E[X] = [E[X1], E[X2], E[X3]]
𖦹 For a random matrix, the expected value is a matrix of expected values of each entry.
• Example:
  E[X] = [ E[X11]  E[X12]  
           E[X21]  E[X22] ]

4. Discrete random variable
𖦹 You can list all possible values clearly.
𖦹 Values are separate and countable.
• Examples: number of children, dice value, number of emails, shoe size.
- You can count each value one by one.
𖦹 Probability is given using a probability mass function (PMF).
• Examples: P(dice = 3) = 1/6, P(emails = 10) = 0.05

5. Continuous random variable
𖦹 You cannot list all possible values.
𖦹 There are infinite values between any two numbers.
• Examples: height, time, temperature.
- Values form a smooth range.
𖦹 Probability is given using a probability density function (PDF).
• A single exact value has zero probability: P(X = 5) = 0
• Probability is over an interval: P(4 < X < 6) = ∫4 to 6 f(x) dx

6. Discrete case
𖦹 A discrete variable takes clear, countable values.
𖦹 To find expectation, we use a sum of all values multiplied by their probabilities.
• Formula: E(Xij) = Σ x ⋅ P(Xij = x)
- This is a weighted average; each value x adds an amount based on how likely it is.
• Example: dice giving 3 with probability 1/6 contributes 3 × 1/6.

7. Continuous case
𖦹 A continuous variable has infinitely many possible values.
𖦹 You cannot list values, so you use integration instead of summing.
• Formula: E(Xij) = ∫ from −∞ to ∞ of x f(x) dx
- f(x) is the probability density function.
- Integration is used because probability spreads over intervals, not single points.

8. MEAN/EXPECTED VALUE

𖦹 Discrete → use sum because values are separate and countable.
• Example: E[X] = Σ x ⋅ P(x)

𖦹 Continuous → use integral because values are infinite and smooth.
• Example: E[X] = ∫ x f(x) dx

9. Expected value rules for random matrices
𖦹 X and Y are random n×p matrices (each entry is a random variable).
𖦹 A and B are fixed matrices, and c is a fixed number.
• All expectations mentioned are assumed to exist.
> Additivity rule
𖦹 The expected value of a sum is the sum of expected values.
• Formula: E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]
> Homogeneity rule
𖦹 If you multiply a random matrix by a number, expectation also gets multiplied by that number.
• Formula: E[cX] = cE[X]
> Multiplying with constant matrices
𖦹 If you multiply X by fixed matrices A and B, expectation follows the same pattern.
• Formula: E[AXB] = A.E[X].B

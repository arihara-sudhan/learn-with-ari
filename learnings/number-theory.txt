--BEGIN--24/11/2025--WELL ORDERING PRINCIPLE--
1. Number theory and natural numbers
𖦹 Number theory studies integers, mainly positive ones: 1, 2, 3, …
𖦹 Positive integers are also called natural numbers

2. Well-Ordering Principle (WOP)
𖦹 [yellow]Every non-empty set S of nonnegative integers has a smallest element[/yellow]
• There is some a in S such that a ≤ b for all b in S
- You can always find the least number in any set of positive integers

3. Archimedean property
𖦹 [yellow]For any positive numbers x and y, there exists a natural number n such that n ⋅ x > y[/yellow]
𖦹 Using WOP, if no such n existed, a set without a smallest element could be formed, which is impossible

--BEGIN--24/11/2025--MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION--
1. Mathematical induction
𖦹 [yellow]Mathematical induction is a way to prove statements for all positive integers[/yellow]
𖦹 It is like a row of dominoes
• If the first domino falls, and every domino knocks down the next one
- Then all dominoes will eventually fall
𖦹 Here, the dominoes are numbers 1, 2, 3, …
• “Falling” means the statement is true for that number

2. First Principle of Finite Induction (Basic Induction)
𖦹 Suppose S is a set of positive integers
𖦹 Base Case: The first number (usually 1) is in S
𖦹 Induction Step: If k is in S, then k+1 is also in S
An Example: Sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers
IMG_URL sum_of_squares.jpg

3. Second Principle of Induction (Strong Induction)
𖦹 Base Case: 1 is in S
𖦹 Strong Induction Step: If all numbers from 1 to k are in S, then k+1 is in S
- This is stronger because it uses all previous numbers, not just k
An Example: Proving inequality in Lucas Sequence

4. Induction for Definitions (Example: Factorials)
𖦹 Factorial n! is defined using induction
𖦹 Base Case: 1! = 1
𖦹 Induction Step: n! = n ⋅ (n−1)! for n > 1
- This builds n! step by step for all positive integers

--BEGIN--25/11/2025--DIVISIBILITY ALGORITHM--
1. Division rule for integers
𖦹 [yellow]For any integers a and b with b > 0, we can find integers q and r such that a = qb + r and 0 ≤ r < b[/yellow]
𖦹 q is called the quotient
𖦹 r is called the remainder
• This means every number can be split into "multiples of b" plus a small leftover r
- r is always smaller than b

2. Example for better understanding
𖦹 Take a = 17 and b = 5
𖦹 17 = 5 × 3 + 2
• So q = 3, r = 2
- Check: 0 ≤ 2 < 5, so it follows the rule

3. In essence
𖦹 Any integer a can be written as:
    a = (divisor × quotient) + remainder
• The remainder is always less than the divisor

4. Meaning of modular form a ≡ b (mod m)
𖦹 [yellow]a ≡ b (mod m) does not mean a = b[/yellow]
𖦹 It means a and b give the same remainder when divided by m
• They behave the same under division by m
- This is called "modulo m"

5. Examples to understand
𖦹 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3)
• Both 10 and 1 leave remainder 1 when divided by 3
𖦹 17 ≡ 2 (mod 5)
• 17 = 5 × 3 + 2, so remainder is 2

--BEGIN--26/11/2025--FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ARITHMETIC--
1. Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
𖦹 Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers.
𖦹 The way to write it as primes is unique, except the order can change.
• Example:
- 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2² ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5
- This way of writing 60 with primes cannot be done differently (order does not matter).

2. Problem on Prime Factorization
𖦹 Find the prime factorization of 84.
• Step 1: Start dividing by the smallest prime number 2.
- 84 ÷ 2 = 42
• Step 2: Divide 42 by 2 again.
- 42 ÷ 2 = 21
• Step 3: Check next prime number 3.
- 21 ÷ 3 = 7
• Step 4: 7 is prime, stop here.
𖦹 Solution: 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 2² ⋅ 3 ⋅ 7

--BEGIN--26/11/2025--EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM FOR GCD/HCF--
𖦹 Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- The largest number that divides two numbers without leaving remainder.
- Example: GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.

𖦹 Euclidean Algorithm to find GCD
• Step 1: Divide the larger number by the smaller number.
• Step 2: Take the remainder.
• Step 3: Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller with the remainder.
• Step 4: Repeat until remainder is 0.
- The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
• Example: Find GCD of 48 and 18
- 48 ÷ 18 = 2 remainder 12
- 18 ÷ 12 = 1 remainder 6
- 12 ÷ 6 = 2 remainder 0
𖦹 GCD = 6

--BEGIN--26/11/2025--BASIC PROPERTIES OF CONGRUENCES--
1. Congruence and Examples
𖦹 Two numbers a and b are congruent modulo n if n divides (a − b).  
- Symbolically: a ≡ b (mod n)  
𖦹 If n does not divide (a − b), a is incongruent to b modulo n.  
- Symbolically: a ≢ b (mod n)
𖦹 Examples with n = 7:
- 3 ≡ 24 (mod 7) because 24 − 3 = 21, and 21 is divisible by 7.  
- 25 ≢ 12 (mod 7) because 25 − 12 = 13, and 13 is not divisible by 7.
𖦹 Special cases:
- Any two integers are congruent modulo 1.  
- Two integers are congruent modulo 2 if both are even or both are odd.  
- Usually, we work with n > 1.

2. Complete Set of Residues
𖦹 A complete set of residues modulo n is a set of n numbers.  
- When each number is divided by n, the remainders are 0, 1, 2, ..., n−1 exactly once.
𖦹 Example modulo 7:
- Set: {−12, −4, 11, 13, 22, 82, 91}
- Find remainders when divided by 7:
  −12 mod 7 = 2  
  −4 mod 7 = 3  
  11 mod 7 = 4  
  13 mod 7 = 6  
  22 mod 7 = 1  
  82 mod 7 = 5  
  91 mod 7 = 0  
- Rearranged remainders: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
𖦹 Important rule: No two numbers in a complete set can have the same remainder modulo n.

3. Division and Remainder
𖦹 When a number a is divided by n, it can be written as:  
- a = q ⋅ n + r  
• q = quotient (how many times n fits completely into a)  
• r = remainder (what is left over), 0 ≤ r < n
𖦹 Example: Divide 17 by 5  
- 17 = 3 ⋅ 5 + 2  
- Quotient q = 3 → 5 fits 3 times in 17  
- Remainder r = 2 → 2 is left over
𖦹 Relation to congruence
- The remainder r is the least nonnegative residue of a modulo n.  
- Example: 17 ≡ 2 (mod 5) → remainder is 2  
𖦹 General rule
- Every number a has exactly one remainder 0 ≤ r < n when divided by n.  
- If remainder is 0, a ≡ 0 (mod n), meaning a is exactly divisible by n.  
- Example: 20 ÷ 5 → remainder 0 → 20 ≡ 0 (mod 5)

4. Congruence by Remainder
𖦹 Two numbers a and b are congruent modulo n if they leave the same remainder when divided by n.  
- Symbolically: a ≡ b (mod n)  
𖦹 a≡b (mod n)⟺remainder of a divided by n=remainder of b divided by n

5. Properties of Congruence
𖦹 Let n > 1 and a, b, c, d be integers.
(a) Reflexive property
𖦹 a ≡ a (mod n)  
    Any number is congruent to itself.  
    Reason: a − a = 0, divisible by n.
(b) Symmetric property
𖦹 If a ≡ b (mod n), then b ≡ a (mod n)  
    Reason: If a − b = k⋅n, then b − a = −k⋅n, still divisible by n.
(c) Transitive property
𖦹 If a ≡ b (mod n) and b ≡ c (mod n), then a ≡ c (mod n)  
    Reason: a − b = h⋅n, b − c = k⋅n → a − c = (h + k)⋅n
(d) Addition and multiplication
𖦹 If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n):  
    Addition: a + c ≡ b + d (mod n)  
    Multiplication: a ⋅ c ≡ b ⋅ d (mod n)  
    Reason: a − b = k₁⋅n, c − d = k₂⋅n → (a+c)−(b+d)=(k₁+k₂)⋅n; multiplication gives extra terms divisible by n.
(e) Special case of addition and multiplication
𖦹 If a ≡ b (mod n), then for any c:  
    a + c ≡ b + c (mod n)  
    a ⋅ c ≡ b ⋅ c (mod n)
(f) Powers
𖦹 If a ≡ b (mod n), then for any positive integer k:  
    a^k ≡ b^k (mod n)  
    Reason: Use induction on k  
    Base: k=1 → true  
    Step: Assume true for k → a^(k+1) = a⋅a^k ≡ b⋅b^k = b^(k+1) (mod n)

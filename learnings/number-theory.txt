--BEGIN--24/11/2025--WELL ORDERING PRINCIPLE--
1. Number theory and natural numbers
𖦹 Number theory studies integers, mainly positive ones: 1, 2, 3, …
𖦹 Positive integers are also called natural numbers

2. Well-Ordering Principle (WOP)
𖦹 [yellow]Every non-empty set S of nonnegative integers has a smallest element[/yellow]
• There is some a in S such that a ≤ b for all b in S
- You can always find the least number in any set of positive integers

3. Archimedean property
𖦹 [yellow]For any positive numbers x and y, there exists a natural number n such that n ⋅ x > y[/yellow]
𖦹 Using WOP, if no such n existed, a set without a smallest element could be formed, which is impossible

--BEGIN--24/11/2025--MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION--
1. Mathematical induction
𖦹 [red]Mathematical induction is a way to prove statements for all positive integers[/red]
𖦹 It is like a row of dominoes
• If the first domino falls, and every domino knocks down the next one
- Then all dominoes will eventually fall
𖦹 Here, the dominoes are numbers 1, 2, 3, …
• “Falling” means the statement is true for that number

2. First Principle of Finite Induction (Basic Induction)
𖦹 Suppose S is a set of positive integers
𖦹 Base Case: The first number (usually 1) is in S
𖦹 Induction Step: If k is in S, then k+1 is also in S
An Example: Sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers

3. Second Principle of Induction (Strong Induction)
𖦹 Base Case: 1 is in S
𖦹 Strong Induction Step: If all numbers from 1 to k are in S, then k+1 is in S
- This is stronger because it uses all previous numbers, not just k
An Example: Proving inequality in Lucas Sequence

4. Induction for Definitions (Example: Factorials)
𖦹 Factorial n! is defined using induction
𖦹 Base Case: 1! = 1
𖦹 Induction Step: n! = n ⋅ (n−1)! for n > 1
- This builds n! step by step for all positive integers

--BEGIN--25/11/2025--DIVISIBILITY ALGORITHM--
1. Division rule for integers
𖦹 [yellow]For any integers a and b with b > 0, we can find integers q and r such that a = qb + r and 0 ≤ r < b[/yellow]
𖦹 q is called the quotient
𖦹 r is called the remainder
• This means every number can be split into "multiples of b" plus a small leftover r
- r is always smaller than b

2. Example for better understanding
𖦹 Take a = 17 and b = 5
𖦹 17 = 5 × 3 + 2
• So q = 3, r = 2
- Check: 0 ≤ 2 < 5, so it follows the rule

3. In essence
𖦹 Any integer a can be written as:
    a = (divisor × quotient) + remainder
• The remainder is always less than the divisor

4. Meaning of modular form a ≡ b (mod m)
𖦹 [yellow]a ≡ b (mod m) does not mean a = b[/yellow]
𖦹 It means a and b give the same remainder when divided by m
• They behave the same under division by m
- This is called "modulo m"

5. Examples to understand
𖦹 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3)
• Both 10 and 1 leave remainder 1 when divided by 3
𖦹 17 ≡ 2 (mod 5)
• 17 = 5 × 3 + 2, so remainder is 2

--BEGIN--24/11/2025--WELL ORDERING PRINCIPLE--
1. Number theory and natural numbers
𖦹 Number theory studies integers, mainly positive ones: 1, 2, 3, …
𖦹 Positive integers are also called natural numbers

2. Well-Ordering Principle (WOP)
𖦹 [red]Every non-empty set S of nonnegative integers has a smallest element[/red]
• There is some a in S such that a ≤ b for all b in S
- You can always find the least number in any set of positive integers

3. Archimedean property
𖦹 [red]For any positive numbers x and y, there exists a natural number n such that n ⋅ x > y[/red]
𖦹 Using WOP, if no such n existed, a set without a smallest element could be formed, which is impossible

4. Proof of Archimedean property
--MATH--START--
𖦹 If a and b are positive numbers, there exists a positive integer n such that n ⋅ a > b
𖦹 Idea: Assume the opposite and show a contradiction using WOP
Step 1: Assume property is false
𖦹 Suppose no such n exists
• Then for every positive integer n: n ⋅ a ≤ b
Step 2: Create a set
𖦹 Define S = {b − n ⋅ a ∣ n is a positive integer}
𖦹 Each element is positive under the assumption
• So S is a non-empty set of positive integers
Step 3: Apply WOP
𖦹 WOP says S has a smallest element
• Let smallest element be b − m ⋅ a for some positive integer m
Step 4: Find a smaller element
𖦹 Consider b − (m+1) ⋅ a
• Algebra: b − (m+1) ⋅ a = (b − m ⋅ a) − a
- Since a > 0, this is smaller than the smallest element, impossible
Step 5: Contradiction
𖦹 The contradiction comes from assuming no n exists
𖦹 Therefore, the assumption is wrong and the Archimedean property is true
--MATH--END--

5. Intuition
𖦹 Adding a repeatedly will eventually pass b
𖦹 WOP ensures a “smallest leftover”; if the property were false, a smaller leftover could be created, which is impossible

--BEGIN--05/12/2025--DIVIDE AND CONQUER--
1. Divide and Conquer
𖦹 Break hard problems into smaller pieces
𖦹 Solve each small piece the same way (recursively)
𖦹 Combine answers from small pieces to get final answer
- Example: Sorting a huge pile by splitting in half, sorting halves, then merging (MergeSort)
𖦹 Faster than brute-force for big problems
- Brute-force like checking every pair of points takes n² time
- Divide and conquer can reduce it to n.log n
𖦹 Analyze speed using recurrence relations
• Recurrence example: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
- Means split job into 2 smaller jobs and do extra work to combine
- Solving gives time complexity like O(n.log n)
𖦹 Useful applications
• Finding two closest points on a map
• Multiplying very big numbers fast
• Comparing two ranked lists
• Cleaning noisy signals
𖦹 Big picture
- Dumb way is already polynomial (like n²)
- Divide and conquer makes it much faster (n.log n or better)
- Goal: not just doable, but blazing fast

2. Karatsuba Multiplication
𖦹 Normal way for multiplying n-digit numbers needs n² small multiplications
𖦹 Example: 123 × 456 needs 9 small multiplications in the usual method
𖦹 Karatsuba splits each number into two halves for faster work
• Example split:
- 123 → 12 | 3
- 456 → 45 | 6
𖦹 Normal half-way method needs 4 multiplications:
• 12 × 45
• 12 × 6
• 3 × 45
• 3 × 6
𖦹 Karatsuba uses only 3 multiplications
• A = 12 × 45
• B = 3 × 6
• C = (12 + 3) × (45 + 6)
- With A, B, C and simple add/subtract, we get the final answer (123 × 456 = 56088)
𖦹 Fewer recursive steps give big speedup when numbers get very large
• Normal method keeps doing 4 half-size problems → time is n²
• Karatsuba keeps doing 3 half-size problems → time is about n¹·⁶
- This makes large-number multiplication much faster
• Formula using split pieces:
x = a·B + b  
y = c·B + d  
Compute:
[pink]p1[/pink] = [yellow]a[/yellow]·[yellow]c[/yellow]  
[pink]p2[/pink] = [yellow]b[/yellow]·[yellow]d[/yellow]  
[pink]p3[/pink] = ([yellow]a[/yellow] + [yellow]b[/yellow])([yellow]c[/yellow] + [yellow]d[/yellow])  
Middle term:
[pink]m[/pink] = [pink]p3[/pink] − [pink]p1[/pink] − [pink]p2[/pink]  
Combine:
x·y = [pink]p1[/pink]·B² + [pink]m[/pink]·B + [pink]p2[/pink]
- Time complexity: roughly n¹·⁶  
- Space complexity: depends on recursion depth, about O(n)
--EMBED-GIT--
https://github.com/arihara-sudhan/dsa/blob/main/algorithms/karatsuba.py
Recurrence Relation: T(n)=3T(n/2)+O(n)
𖦹 Large example: 12345678 × 87654321
• Level 0: two 8-digit numbers  
• Choose B = 10⁴  
• Split:  
- 12345678 → 1234 | 5678  
- 87654321 → 8765 | 4321
𖦹 Karatsuba Level-1 (three 4-digit × 4-digit problems)
• [pink]p1[/pink] = 1234 × 8765  
• [pink]p2[/pink] = 5678 × 4321  
• [pink]p3[/pink] = (1234 + 5678)(8765 + 4321) = 6912 × 13086
𖦹 Karatsuba Level-2 (nine 2-digit × 2-digit problems)
• Examples: 12×87, 34×65, 46×152, 56×43, 78×21, 134×64, 69×130, 12×86, 81×216
𖦹 Karatsuba Level-3 (base case)
• Single-digit multiplications like 1×8, 2×7, 3×5, etc.
- Total: 27 one-digit multiplications
- This is the stopping point
- Time complexity: about n¹·⁶  
- Space complexity: depends on recursion depth, roughly O(n)

3. Strassen Matrix Multiplication
𖦹 Normal 2×2 multiplication needs 8 multiplications
• Example: [ a b ] × [ e f ] → results:
  [ c d ]   [ g h ]  
- Each result: a·e + b·g, a·f + b·h, c·e + d·g, c·f + d·h → total 8 multiplications
𖦹 For n×n matrices → n³ multiplications
- Example: n = 1024 → over a billion multiplications

𖦹 Strassen reduces 2×2 multiplication to 7 multiplications
• M1 = (a + d)(e + h)  
• M2 = (c + d)·e  
• M3 = a·(f − h)  
• M4 = d·(g − e)  
• M5 = (a + b)·h  
• M6 = (c − a)(e + f)  
• M7 = (b − d)(g + h)
- Final 4 entries are built from M1…M7 using only additions/subtractions
- 2×2 multiplication: 8 → 7 multiplications

𖦹 Divide-and-conquer for big matrices
• Split n×n matrices into four (n/2)×(n/2) blocks:  
  A = [ A11  A12 ]   B = [ B11  B12 ]  
      [ A21  A22 ]       [ B21  B22 ]
• Use 7-trick recursively on blocks
• Combine the seven results with additions/subtractions to get final matrix
--EMBED-GIT--
https://github.com/arihara-sudhan/dsa/blob/main/algorithms/strassen.py
𖦹 Recurrence relation
• T(n) = 7 · T(n/2) + O(n²)  
- Only 7 recursive calls per level
- Extra O(n²) = additions and subtractions of blocks

𖦹 Speed comparison
• Normal method: n³ multiplications  
• Strassen method: roughly n²·⁸⁰⁷ multiplications  
- Example: 1024×1024 → ~10⁹ normal vs ~10⁸ Strassen → 7–8× faster  
- Example: 1,000,000×1,000,000 → hundreds of times faster
- Current best: n²·³⁷²⁸⁶, but Strassen started the revolution
- Time complexity: roughly n²·⁸⁰⁷  
- Space complexity: O(n²) for storing intermediate blocks

--BEGIN--05/12/2025--GREEDY TECHNIQUES--
1. Greedy Method
𖦹 Make a choice that looks best at the moment (local optimum)
𖦹 Repeat this step by step
𖦹 Hope these local choices lead to global best
- In short: "Take the best option now and keep going"
𖦹 Key idea
• Works step by step
• Does not go back or change previous choices
• Always chooses locally best option
- If problem has greedy-choice property → gives global best
𖦹 Examples
• Coin Change Problem (with standard coins)
- Always pick largest coin ≤ remaining amount
• Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Pick items with highest value/weight ratio first
• Activity Selection Problem
- Pick next activity that finishes earliest
𖦹 Time Complexity
• Depends on how choices are selected
• O(n log n) if sorting is needed
• O(n) if no sorting is required

2. Huffman Coding
𖦹 Huffman coding compresses text by giving short codes to frequent characters and long codes to rare characters
𖦹 Goal: make the total message size as small as possible
𖦹 Steps to build Huffman code
• Step 1: Count frequency of each character
- Example "AABABC": A=3, B=2, C=1
• Step 2: Build tree using greedy rule
- Always pick two least frequent items and combine
- Example:
  - Start nodes: C(1), B(2), A(3)
  - Combine C(1) + B(2) → Node(3)
  - Combine Node(3) + A(3) → Root(6)
• Step 3: Assign binary codes from tree
- Go left → 0, go right → 1
- Example codes:
  - A = 0  
  - C = 10  
  - B = 11
• Step 4: Encode message
- "AABABC" → 0 0 11 0 11 10 → 001101110
- Original: 6 characters × 8 bits = 48 bits  
- Huffman: 9 bits → ~80% smaller
--EMBED-GIT--
https://github.com/arihara-sudhan/dsa/blob/main/algorithms/huffman.py
𖦹 Another example: "beep"
• Frequency: b=1, e=2, p=1
• Build tree:
  - Combine b(1)+p(1) → Node(2)
  - Combine Node(2)+e(2) → Root(4)
• Assign codes: e=1, b=00, p=01
• Encode "beep": b e e p → 00 1 1 01 → 001101
- Original 4×8 = 32 bits → Huffman 6 bits
- Time complexity: O(n log n) (for building tree with n characters)  
- Space complexity: O(n) (to store tree and codes)

3. Interval Scheduling (Maximum Non-Overlapping Intervals)
𖦹 Goal: Select the maximum number of intervals that do not overlap
𖦹 Correct greedy strategy:
• Sort intervals by ending time (earliest first)
• Pick the first interval
• Repeatedly pick next interval that starts after or when the last picked one ends
- Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
- Optimal: YES
𖦹 Activity Selection Problem
• You are given n intervals [start_time, end_time]
• Select maximum number of non-overlapping intervals
• Golden greedy rule: always pick interval with earliest finish among remaining compatible intervals
𖦹 Step-by-step algorithm
• Sort all intervals by end time (ascending)
• Initialize: count = 0, last_end_time = -∞
• For each interval in sorted order:
  - If start_time ≥ last_end_time → take it
  - Then count++, update last_end_time = end_time
• Return count
𖦹 Example 1
• Intervals: A(1-4), B(3-5), C(0-6), D(5-7), E(8-9), F(5-9), G(3-8)
• Sorted by end time: A(1-4), B(3-5), C(0-6), D(5-7), G(3-8), F(5-9), E(8-9)
• Greedy selection:
  - Pick A → last_end = 4
  - Next compatible: D → last_end = 7
  - Next compatible: E → last_end = 9
• Selected: A, D, E → 3 intervals (maximum possible)
--EMBED-GIT--
https://github.com/arihara-sudhan/dsa/blob/main/algorithms/activity_selection.py
𖦹 Example 2: Where other strategies fail
• Picking longest → only 1 interval
• Picking shortest duration → easy to mess order → not always optimal
• Picking earliest start → only 1 interval
• Correct greedy (earliest finish) → picks A → B → C → 3 intervals (optimal)
𖦹 Proof of optimality
• Theorem: earliest finish greedy always selects maximum intervals
• Proof idea: “Greedy stays ahead” + exchange argument
• Let G = greedy solution, O = any optimal solution
• Sort both by finish time
• By induction, k-th interval in G finishes no later than k-th in O
- Therefore G fits at least as many intervals as O → optimal

4. Set Cover Problem
𖦹 Goal: Find the fewest subsets whose union is the entire universe U
𖦹 Given:
• Universe U = {1,2,...,n}
• Family of subsets S₁, S₂,..., Sₘ ⊆ U
• Cost of each subset: usually 1 (unweighted) or cᵢ (weighted)
𖦹 Set Cover is NP-hard → no exact polynomial-time solution
𖦹 Greedy algorithm gives best possible approximation
𖦹 Greedy Algorithm
--EMBED-GIT--
https://github.com/arihara-sudhan/dsa/blob/main/algorithms/set_cover.py
• Initialize: C = ∅ (selected sets), Covered = ∅
• While Covered ≠ U:
  - Pick set Sⱼ that covers the most new elements not yet covered
  - Add Sⱼ to C
  - Update Covered = Covered ∪ Sⱼ
  - Remove elements in Sⱼ from consideration
• Return C
𖦹 Two versions of Set Cover
• Unweighted: minimize number of sets, all sets cost same
  - Greedy: pick set covering most new elements
• Weighted: minimize total cost, each set has a price
  - Greedy: pick set with best ratio (new elements covered ÷ cost)
𖦹 Example 1: Unweighted Set Cover
• Universe = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, Sets:
  - A={1,2,3,4}, B={3,4,5,6}, C={1,2}, D={3,4}, E={5,6}
• Step-by-step greedy:
  - Pick A → covers {1,2,3,4}
  - Pick B → covers {5,6}
• Total sets used = 2 (optimal)
𖦹 Example 2: Weighted Set Cover
• Same universe, sets with costs:
  - A=100, B=100, C=10, D=10, E=10
• Step-by-step weighted greedy (pick max new/cost):
  - Ratios: C=0.2, D=0.2, E=0.2, A=0.04
  - Pick C, D, E → total cost = 30 (optimal)
• Wrong unweighted greedy (pick most new elements) → total cost 110
𖦹 Approximation Guarantee
• Greedy solution uses at most Hₙ × OPT sets
  - OPT = size of optimal cover
  - Hₙ = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n ≈ ln n + 1
• Best possible: no algorithm can do better than ln n-approximation unless P=NP
• For n ≤ 1000 → Hₙ ≤ ~7 → greedy at most 7× optimal
𖦹 Time Complexity: O(mn) for unweighted, can be improved with heaps  
𖦹 Space Complexity: O(n + m) (to track covered elements and sets)

--BEGIN--05/12/2025--DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING--
1. What is Dynamic Programming
𖦹 Dynamic Programming (DP) solves problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems and storing their results to avoid repeating work
𖦹 Used when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
𖦹 Key Features
• Optimal Substructure
- Solution of problem can be built from solutions of subproblems
- Example: shortest path in a graph uses shortest paths of smaller segments
• Overlapping Subproblems
- Same subproblems appear multiple times
- Example: Fibonacci numbers → fib(n-1) and fib(n-2) are reused

2. Difference from Divide and Conquer
𖦹 Subproblems: Divide & Conquer = independent, DP = overlapping
𖦹 Strategy: Divide & Conquer = solve recursively, DP = solve recursively or iteratively + store results
𖦹 Time Complexity: Divide & Conquer often O(2^n), DP usually polynomial O(n), O(n²), etc.
𖦹 Example: Divide & Conquer = Merge Sort, DP = Fibonacci, Knapsack

3. Two Approaches in DP
A. Top-Down (Memoization)
𖦹 Solve main problem recursively
𖦹 Store results of subproblems in cache (dictionary or array)
𖦹 Before solving subproblem, check if result exists
𖦹 Example: Fibonacci Numbers
[pink]def[/pink] [yellow]fib_memo(n, memo={}):[/yellow]
    [pink]if[/pink] [yellow]n in memo:[/yellow]
        [pink]return[/pink] [yellow]memo[n][/yellow]
    [pink]if[/pink] [yellow]n <= 1:[/yellow]
        [pink]return[/pink] [yellow]n[/yellow]
    [yellow]memo[n] = fib_memo(n-1, memo) + fib_memo(n-2, memo)[/yellow]
    [pink]return[/pink] [yellow]memo[n][/yellow]
[ pink]print[/pink]([yellow]fib_memo(10)[/yellow])  # 55
𖦹 Time Complexity: O(n)
𖦹 Space Complexity: O(n) (for memo + recursion stack)

B. Bottom-Up (Tabulation)
𖦹 Solve smallest subproblems first
𖦹 Build solution iteratively
𖦹 Often uses arrays to store intermediate results
𖦹 Example: Fibonacci Numbers
[pink]def[/pink] [yellow]fib_tab(n):[/yellow]
    [pink]if[/pink] [yellow]n <= 1:[/yellow]
        [pink]return[/pink] [yellow]n[/yellow]
    [yellow]dp = [0]*(n+1)[/yellow]
    [yellow]dp[0], dp[1] = 0, 1[/yellow]
    [pink]for[/pink] [yellow]i in range(2, n+1):[/yellow]
        [yellow]dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2][/yellow]
    [pink]return[/pink] [yellow]dp[n][/yellow]
[pink]print[/pink]([yellow]fib_tab(10)[/yellow])  # 55
𖦹 Time Complexity: O(n)
𖦹 Space Complexity: O(n) (can reduce to O(1) using two variables)

4. Common DP Problems
𖦹 Fibonacci sequence
• Subproblem: fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
𖦹 0/1 Knapsack Problem
• Subproblem: max value for first i items and capacity w
𖦹 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
• Subproblem: LCS of first i characters of string1 and first j of string2
𖦹 Matrix Chain Multiplication
• Subproblem: minimum multiplications for matrices i to j
𖦹 Coin Change Problem
• Subproblem: min number of coins to make amount x

5. Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)
𖦹 Problem Statement
• Given matrices A1, A2, ..., An with dimensions pi-1 × pi
• Goal: Multiply all matrices A1 × A2 × ... × An with minimum scalar multiplications
- Only multiplication cost matters, not the resulting matrix
𖦹 Example
• A1: 10×30, A2: 30×5, A3: 5×60
• (A1 × A2) × A3 → cost = 10×30×5 + 10×5×60 = 4500 (optimal)
• A1 × (A2 × A3) → cost = 30×5×60 + 10×30×60 = 27000
--EMBED-GIT--
https://github.com/arihara-sudhan/dsa/blob/main/algorithms/matrix_chain_multiplication.py
𖦹 Key Idea
• Optimal Substructure
- Minimum cost for multiplying matrices i to j = min over all k (i ≤ k < j) of:
  m[i][k] + m[k+1][j] + pi-1 × pk × pj
- Base case: m[i][i] = 0 (single matrix, no multiplication)
• Overlapping Subproblems
- Subchains like A1×A2, A2×A3 are used multiple times
𖦹 DP Table
• Use dp[i][j] to store minimum cost for multiplying matrices i to j
• Fill table by increasing chain length from 2 to n
𖦹 Recurrence Relation
dp[i][j] = min over k = i to j-1 of (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + pi-1 × pk × pj)
• Iterate i = n…1
• Iterate j = i+1…n
• Iterate k = i…j-1
𖦹 Complexity
• Time Complexity: O(n³) → 3 nested loops
• Space Complexity: O(n²) → DP table

6. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
𖦹 Problem Statement
• Given a weighted directed graph with n vertices
• Some edges may be missing (no direct connection)
• Goal: Find shortest distances between all pairs of vertices
- Works with negative edge weights if no negative cycles exist
- Finds all-pairs shortest paths unlike Dijkstra
𖦹 Key Idea (Dynamic Programming)
• Let dist[i][j] = shortest distance from vertex i to vertex j
• Consider vertices 1 to k as possible intermediate points
• Recurrence:
  dist[i][j][k] = min(dist[i][j][k-1], dist[i][k][k-1] + dist[k][j][k-1])
- dist[i][j][k-1] → shortest distance without using vertex k
- dist[i][k][k-1] + dist[k][j][k-1] → shortest distance through vertex k
• Simpler version:
- Start with dist[i][j] = weight[i][j] (∞ if no edge)
- For each intermediate vertex k = 0..n-1:
  • For each pair (i, j):
    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
- After all vertices considered, dist[i][j] = shortest path from i to j

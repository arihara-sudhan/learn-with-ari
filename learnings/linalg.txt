1. Vector space axioms
𖦹 A vector space has a set V with two actions: adding vectors and multiplying a vector by a number.
𖦹 The following rules must hold for all vectors u, v, w in V and numbers c, d.
• Axioms for addition (5 rules)
    - Closure: u + v stays inside V.
    - Commutative: u + v = v + u.
    - Associative: (u + v) + w = u + (v + w).
    - Zero vector: there is a 0 in V such that u + 0 = u.
    - Additive inverse: each u has a −u such that u + (−u) = 0.
• Axioms for scalar multiplication (4 rules)
    - Closure: cu stays inside V.
    - Distributive over vectors: c(u + v) = cu + cv.
    - Distributive over scalars: (c + d)u = cu + du.
    - Associative with scalars: c(du) = (cd)u.
• Scalar identity (1 rule)
    - 1u = u.

2. Definition of span
𖦹 The span of vectors v1, v2, v3 is the set of all vectors made using:
• c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3
- Here c1, c2, c3 are any real numbers.
𖦹 It means “all possible combinations of these vectors.”

3. Linear independence
𖦹 A set of vectors is linearly independent when the only way to make:
• c1v1 + c2v2 + … + cnvn = 0
is to have all c1 = c2 = … = cn = 0.
𖦹 In simple words: no vector can be made from others; none is redundant.
• Example of independent
    - v1 = (1, 0), v2 = (0, 1).
    - Solving a(1, 0) + b(0, 1) = (0, 0) gives a = 0, b = 0 → independent.
• Linear dependence
    - A set is dependent if there exists at least one non-zero choice of c1, c2, …, cn that makes:
c1v1 + c2v2 + … + cnvn = 0.
    - Meaning one vector can be made from others.
• Example of dependent
    - v1 = (1, 2), v2 = (2, 4).
    - a(1, 2) + b(2, 4) = (0, 0) has many solutions (like a = 2, b = −1).
    - So dependent. Also v2 = 2v1.
𖦹 Quick idea:
• In R²: two vectors are independent if they are not on the same line.
• In R³: three vectors are independent if they are not in the same plane.

4. Basis of a vector space
𖦹 A set B = {v1, v2, …, vn} is a basis of V if:
• The vectors are linearly independent.
• They span the full space V.
- Meaning every vector in V can be written as:
  a1v1 + a2v2 + … + anvn.
